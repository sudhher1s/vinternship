<h2 id="about-the-program">About the Program</h2>

<p>Welcome to <strong>Pinternship</strong> – a comprehensive <strong>Full-Stack Development Internship Program</strong> conducted under the expert guidance of <strong>Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar</strong> at <strong>IIT Ropar’s VLED Lab</strong>.</p>

<p>This internship is designed for learners who genuinely want to understand how modern web applications are built. Instead of focusing only on theory, the program emphasizes applying concepts in realistic development scenarios and building systems that resemble real production applications.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-youll-learn">What You’ll Learn</h2>

<p>This program follows a carefully structured learning path that covers the complete <strong>MERN stack</strong> along with the development practices used in modern software teams.</p>

<p>You will begin with the <strong>basics of JavaScript</strong>, building a strong foundation in core programming concepts. You will then move on to <strong>TypeScript</strong>, with a focus on writing safe, manageable, and more predictable JavaScript. After that, you will learn <strong>React</strong> to build interactive, component-driven user interfaces. On the backend, the program introduces <strong>MongoDB</strong> for designing and managing scalable databases, followed by <strong>Express.js</strong> for handling APIs and server-side logic.</p>

<p>As you progress, you will also work with concepts such as state management, RESTful API design, middleware usage, database queries and aggregations, performance optimization, and testing. These topics are introduced gradually and reinforced through practical implementation rather than isolated theory.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="program-structure">Program Structure</h2>

<p><img src="../Genie-phases.png" alt="Pinternship phases" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;" /></p>

<p>The internship is organized into three mandatory components that together form a complete learning journey.</p>

<h3 id="1-core-learning-vibe-training-required">1. Core Learning: ViBe Training (Required)</h3>

<p>This phase focuses on building strong fundamentals. All required modules are completed on the <strong>ViBe platform</strong>, covering TypeScript, React, Express.js, and MongoDB. The goal here is to develop a clear understanding of core concepts before moving on to more complex applications.</p>

<h3 id="2-advanced-learning-case-studies-required">2. Advanced Learning: Case Studies (Required)</h3>

<p>Once the foundations are in place, you will work through a series of case studies based on real-world problems. These case studies encourage you to think through design decisions, understand trade-offs, and implement solutions that resemble real development workflows.</p>

<h3 id="3-practical-learning-projects-required">3. Practical Learning: Projects (Required)</h3>

<p>In the final phase, you will apply everything you have learned by building complete projects. These projects are designed to reflect real-world applications and help you demonstrate your ability to work across the entire stack, from frontend interfaces to backend services and databases.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="opportunities-for-top-performers">Opportunities for Top Performers</h2>

<p>Participants who consistently perform well and complete all program requirements may receive recommendations from the VLED Lab. In some cases, this can also lead to further internship or project opportunities with us.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning Resources</h2>

<h3 id="vibe-platform">ViBe Platform</h3>

<p>The ViBe platform serves as the central learning hub for the program. All mandatory training modules are hosted here and should be completed in sequence as part of the internship requirements.</p>

<h3 id="case-studies">Case Studies</h3>

<p>Case studies are tightly aligned with the ViBe training modules and are meant to strengthen understanding through application. They are available across different areas of the stack, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../case-studies/#typescript">TypeScript Fundamentals</a></li>
  <li><a href="../case-studies/#react">React Development</a></li>
  <li><a href="../case-studies/#express">Express.js Backend</a></li>
  <li><a href="../case-studies/#mongodb">MongoDB Database</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Each case study presents a problem to solve, explains the underlying concepts, and walks through practical implementation while highlighting best practices and commonly used patterns.</p>

<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>

<p>Projects form a core part of the learning experience. Instead of standalone assignments, you will contribute to <strong>ongoing real-world projects</strong>, working on specific features alongside our development team. This hands-on approach allows you to gain practical experience with production-level code, workflows, and collaboration practices. These contributions are designed to be portfolio-worthy and reflect the skills and expectations of a full-stack developer.</p>

<p>You can explore the available <a href="../projects/">Projects</a> to understand the ongoing work, feature scope, and contribution expectations.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>To begin the program, start by reviewing the <a href="../Conceptnote/">Concept Note</a> to understand the overall structure and expectations. If you have questions, the <a href="../faq/">FAQ Section</a> provides answers to common concerns.</p>

<p>Once you are familiar with the program, begin with the ViBe training modules, and gradually move on to the required <a href="../case-studies/">Case Studies</a>. After completing these, you can start working on your <a href="../projects/">Projects</a>. Throughout the journey, you can use the chatbot for quick guidance and collaborate with other participants in the community.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="program-goals">Program Goals</h2>

<p>By the end of the internship, you should be comfortable building complete full-stack applications using the MERN stack. You will have experience designing scalable systems, writing maintainable code, and following industry-standard practices. Most importantly, you will leave the program with a set of real projects that demonstrate your skills and learning progress.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="evaluation-criteria">Evaluation Criteria</h2>

<p>Your performance is evaluated based on your progress through the ViBe training modules, successful completion of all case studies and projects, and the overall quality of your work. Consistent engagement, clean code, and thoughtful implementation are key factors in the evaluation process.</p>

<p>Strong performers may receive recommendations or internship opportunities with VLED Lab.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="support--community">Support &amp; Community</h2>

<p>Throughout the program, you will receive guidance from Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar and the VLED Lab team. You can check the Help section, which provides you with information regarding available support, protocols, policies, and community channels.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ready-to-begin">Ready to Begin?</h2>

<p>To get started, access the ViBe platform and begin working through the training modules. From there, progress to the case studies and then to the projects. Completing all three components is required to successfully finish the program.</p>

<p>Stay consistent, ask questions when needed, and make the most of the learning experience.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s build something meaningful together.</strong></p>
