## Common Issues & Solutions

### "No course enrolled" Message

If you see this message after accepting the invite, first verify your email address and check for any email aliases. If the issue persists, contact Support at **pinternship-support@vicharanashala.zohodesk.in**.

### Video Issues (Stuck, Looping, or Skipping)

If you're experiencing video issues, try these troubleshooting steps in order. Start by refreshing the page multiple times. If that doesn't work, check the browser console by right-clicking, selecting Inspect, going to the Network or Console tab, and watching the video to check for any errors. Next, try logging out and logging back in again. If the problem continues, switch to a different browser or clear your browsing data and cache before re-logging in.

If the issue persists after trying all these steps, record the problem and email it to **pinternship-support@vicharanashala.zohodesk.in** between 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM.

### Progress Showing Less Than 100%

If you've completed all videos and quizzes but your progress still shows less than 100%, don't worry. This is a known dashboard-level technical issue that the support team is actively working on. Your progress will be updated automatically once the issue is fixed. You can try refreshing your browser or clearing your cache once, but no further action is required from your side.

## Important Points to Remember

### Video Viewing

Videos are sequential and can only be watched in sequence. The platform requires camera and microphone access, proper lighting conditions, and minimal background noise to ensure a smooth learning experience.

### Email Consistency

Please ensure that you are registered on the ViBe platform with the NPTEL registered Email ID only. This is important for proper progress tracking throughout the internship.

### Course Completion

Completion of all ViBe platform course modules is required as part of the Core Learning component of the Pinternship program.
